### Problem it solves
Tracking calories will help you eat your food guilt-free. Our project aims to provide a better understanding of calories and to monitor them will only help users make easier and healthier food choices to reach their specific goals. It allows people to know about calories contained in daily consumed food items and suggests meals according to the number of calories they want to consume. It is helpful for people who do not get enough time because of their busy schedule to plan their meals and reach their fitness goals who otherwise would give up the path of healthy life due to the crunch of time.

### How our project works
First, the user will get to choose whether they want to know the number of calories contained in common food items or they want to get a suggestion for a meal.
If they choose the latter option they will be asked about the meal which they want to have i.e breakfast,lunch or dinner.Then they will get to choose the number of calories they want to consume and get suggestions regarding their meals.
### Future scope
In the hectic lifestyles the people are leading these days, they often ignore their health ,and even if they do workout,they often tend to ignore their diet planning due to time constraint and other reasons due to which their efforts in working out goes into vain . This project helps them to quickly get meal suggestions according to the number of calories they want to consume and relieves them of the efforts of browsing the web for number of calories contained in different things and with improvements it will make diet balancing very easy and less time consuming in the future which will help people lead a healthy life.
